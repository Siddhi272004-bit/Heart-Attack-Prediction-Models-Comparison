## 📌 Overview

**Heart-Attack-Prediction-Models-Comparison** is a comprehensive machine learning web application built using **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn**. It compares multiple ML algorithms to predict the risk of heart attacks using medical data.

This tool is aimed at healthcare professionals and developers to help identify heart attack risks efficiently using various algorithms, with visual performance evaluations and user-friendly predictions.

### Why use this project?

- 📊 **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple models like XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.
- 🤖 **Prediction Interface**: Easily enter personal medical information to get risk predictions.
- 📈 **Visualization Tools**: Compare performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Specificity, and ROC-AUC curves.
